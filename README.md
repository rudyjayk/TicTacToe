You can also choose to use a standard 3X3 playing grid or you can adjust the grid up to 10X10.
All logisitcs of Tic-tac-Toe works out for a standard game and various methods.

Within the setings tab you are able to change the font color and the the background color of the application.
There is also a save feature that will store locally a file with the game state that it was in. It still is kinda buggy but does the job for most the time.
